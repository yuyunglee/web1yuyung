"stand fast!" he shouted. "drop the guns! hands in the air!"
<p>Bootlip thomas and murray bratcher wouldn't hear of it.
they came to a halt, but their pistols came up firing.
one shot whistled past sam burrack's head before he let the hammer fall.
bratcher twisted in a half circle, then collapsed with a bullet through his chest.

Sam stepped forward with caution.
he reached oyt with his boot and kicked the still-breathing Bootlip's pistol away from his hand.
Bootlip gasped and tried to raise his face and speak.
All that came out was a choked cough.

"I've heard it all be-fore."</p>
